## Getting Started

Datasets are the primary object in any data analysis endeavor.  

Within the SRT framework, datasets are at the core. Start by importing your own datasets:

1. Click the`import` menu button under `File` or by clicking [[file icon]].
2. A `New Tab` should populate with the `File Name` as the Tab Title.
3. Click the `New Tab` to navigate to your imported dataset. If you close the `Welcome Tab`, you can view this page again by pressing the [[Home Icon]]

This new tab will present a `DataDashboard`, a view pane with several filter and sort options to view your dataset. Lets take a closer look at the widgets within the `DataDashboard`.

### Descriptive Statistics

The left column houses some descriptive widgets so you can quickly view each *feature* and gather a snapshot what the data represents. 

Underneath the `Columns` Header click on the dataset name to view a drop down list of all the *attributes* within the dataset. 

The left column, `DataTypes`, describes the variable datatype within the analytics model engine. We plan to allow for the complex management of handle all data types. Currently we can safely handle integers (`int`), floating point numbers (`float`), and text (`str` or `object`).

To see some visualizations of an individual variable, click on the attribute name underneath the drop down menu. A plot should be shown in the left column of the `DataDashboard` along with some summary statistics.

### Filtering and Sorting


On the top will be another tool bar with `Describe`, `Plot`, and `Report` options. 

Lets look closer at each of these buttons.
