  <h1>Welcome to Student Retention Analysis</h1>
    
    <p>Unlock the full potential of educational success with the Student Retention Analytics Tool (SRT). Our cutting-edge platform empowers educators and institutions to enhance student retention through data-driven insights. With the SRT, you can identify at-risk students early, tailor support services effectively, and craft strategic interventions that boost academic perseverance. Embrace the power of analytics and transform your approach to student retention with the SRT‚Äîwhere data paves the way to academic excellence.</p>
    
    <p>Our project adheres to <b>FERPA</b> compliance by implementing robust measures to safeguard student data privacy. We ensure that all personally identifiable information (PII) is securely stored, accessed only by authorized personnel, and used solely for educational purposes. Our platform employs encryption protocols, access controls, and regular audits to maintain FERPA standards and protect student confidentiality.</p>
    
    <p>The SRT application is the <em>first-line</em> tool for ensuring the health of retention rates among students.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started üöÄ</h2>
    <p>Datasets are the <em>primary</em> object in any data analysis endeavor.Therefore, within the SRT framework, datasets are at the core. </p>
    <p> <b>Start:</b> Import your own datasets</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click the <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#00a8e9" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file"><path d="M13 2H6a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v16a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h12a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V9z"></path><polyline points="13 2 13 9 20 9"></polyline></svg> icon button or under <b>File</b> select <b>Import Data</b>.</li>
      <li>Use the file dialog to select a CSV file</li>
      <li>After import a new <b>Tab</b> will populate within the main screen.</li>
      <li>Navigate to this new <b>Tab</b> by clicking on the tab.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This new tab will present a <code>DataDashboard</code>, a view pane with several filter and sort options to view your dataset. Let's take a closer look at the widgets within the <code>DataDashboard</code>.</p>
  <h3>Descriptive Statistics üîç</h3>
    <p>The left column houses some descriptive widgets so you can quickly view each <em>feature</em> and gather a snapshot of what the data represents.</p>
    <p>Underneath the <code>Columns</code> Header, click on the dataset name to view a drop-down list of all the <em>attributes</em> within the dataset.</p>
    <p>The left column, <code>DataTypes</code>, describes the variable datatype within the analytics model engine. We plan to allow for the complex management of handling all data types. Currently, we can safely handle integers (<code>int</code>), floating-point numbers (<code>float</code>), and text (<code>str</code> or <code>object</code>).</p>
    <p>To see some visualizations of an individual variable, click on the attribute name underneath the drop-down menu. A plot should be shown in the left column of the <code>DataDashboard</code> along with some summary statistics.</p>
  <h3>Filtering and Sorting üéõÔ∏è</h3>

    <p>On the top will be another toolbar with <code>Describe</code>, <code>Plot</code>, and <code>Report</code> options.</p>

    <p>Let's look closer at each of these buttons.</p>

    <hr>

  <h2>Describe üìä</h2>

    <p>Describe the dataset with some standard statistic plots for the various columns.</p>

  <h2>Plot üìà</h2>

    <p>Here are some plots.</p>

  <h3>Bar Chart üìä</h3>

    <p>A bar chart is a graphical representation of categorical data with rectangular bars whose lengths are proportional to the values they represent. Bar charts are used to compare two or more categories.</p>

  <h3>Pie Chart ü•ß</h3>

    <p>A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic that is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. Pie charts are used to show proportions of a whole, and the arc length of each slice is proportional to the quantity it represents.</p>

  <h2>Report üìÑ</h2>
    <p>Clicking the <code>Reports</code> icon with an imported dataset will bring up the <em>predicitive</em> analysis screen.
    This view houses some unqiue features within SRT, democratizing machine learning for retention analysis. Adminstrative users can 
    select a <code>Target Variable</code>, specify which machine learning model to use based on variable parameter, and define the
    test-train split size. Once these parameters are specified the user can run the model to get an output of the results.
    </p>

    <p>Once ran, the view will populate with a <b>Right Dock Widget</b> showing each model and the <code>accuracy</code>, <code>run time</code>, and 
    <code>confusion matrix</code>. When the user navigates to each model, the confusion matrix will be displayed within the main view.</p>

    <p>The <b>Confusion Matrix</b> allows the admin to view the counts of the true positives and false negatives from the classification model.</p>
